# üéÅ **Gift Card Barcode Generator Tool** üéÅ

## üìå **Overview**
Welcome to the **Gift Card Barcode Generator Tool**! This Python-based tool is designed to help you generate serialized gift cards with dynamic barcodes, all in an easy-to-use, automated manner. With just an Excel sheet containing serial numbers and a gift card background image, the tool will generate a PowerPoint file with barcodes and serial numbers ready to print.

It‚Äôs perfect for anyone who needs to create and print a large batch of gift cards quickly and accurately. Whether you're working on a small project or handling large-scale production, this tool will save you time and effort.

## üöÄ **Key Features**
- **Excel Input:** Import serial numbers directly from an Excel file (XLSX).
- **Dynamic Barcode Generation:** Automatically creates high-quality barcodes based on each serial number.
- **Customizable Gift Card Background:** Choose a PNG or JPEG image as your gift card background.
- **PowerPoint Output:** Generate a PowerPoint (.pptx) file where each slide contains a serial number and barcode for easy printing.
- **Fast and Efficient:** Perfect for printing any number of gift cards, whether it's 10 or 1,000.

## üí° **How It Works**
1. **Prepare Your Files:**
   - **Excel File:** Have your serial numbers in an Excel file (XLSX) with a column named "Serial Number".
   - **Background Image:** Place a PNG or JPEG image file of your gift card background in the same directory as the script.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - The tool will read the serial numbers from the Excel file and generate barcodes for each one.

3. **Generate PowerPoint:** 
   - Each serial number and its corresponding barcode will be added to a new slide in the PowerPoint file.
   - You can then print the slides to get your gift cards ready!

2. **Gift Card Background Image:**
   - Ensure the gift card background image (PNG or JPEG) is in the same directory as the script. The script will use this image to place the serial number and barcode.

3. **Running the Script:**
   - When you run the script, it will generate a PowerPoint file named `gift_cards.pptx` containing one slide for each serial number.
   
4. **Printing Your Gift Cards:**
   - Open the generated PowerPoint file, and you can print the slides directly or use it for further design editing.

## üé® **Customization Options**
- **Background Image:** Choose any PNG or JPEG file for the gift card background. Ensure it is the desired size for your cards.
- **Barcode Formats:** The script supports different barcode formats, such as Code128, for flexibility.
